# Baseball_teams_analysis_R_project

- This project involved using several datasets about American baseball from the R package 'Lahman'. It is adapted from Loughborough University's 21MAP501 Coursework.
- A simple linear regression model was developed in order to predict the logarithm (base 10) of mean salaries of baseball teams. This is showm in Figure 2.
- A multiple regression model was developed to predict the number of runs made by a player based on features such as player age, height, team, year, position and number of hits.
- Finally a lasso regression model for logistic regression was explored in order to predict division winners. The sum of specificity and sensitivity was between 1.79 and 1.87 for all 3 divisions, indicating that the prediction was almost equally good across all divisions.
